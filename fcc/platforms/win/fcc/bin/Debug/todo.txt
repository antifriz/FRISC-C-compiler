Version: v0.9.4.1.light W7/XP
Author: ivan.jurin@fer.hr

Tested on:
-Windows 7
-Windows XP SP2
-linux version soon...

Checking:
-check installation procedure
-check importing procedure
-check built-in functions reliability

To implement:
-warn about backuping .bash_profile (.bash_profile_old at importing but 
 overwrites last one)
-function calls with arrays as parameters for functions 
 (i.e. 'f(a[i]);' in gimple is left as is)
-add all built-in functions

Left unimplemented:
-arrays of more than one dimension unimplemented
-switch unimplemented
-structs unimplemented
-typedef unimplemented
-declaring variable as extern not directly implement but there is high 
 possibility it functions as it should (needs to be checked)
